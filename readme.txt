This plugin provides a simple way to edit some of the privacy related settings available in WordPress.

== Description ==
Privacy WP provides a simple to use interface to edit some of the privacy related settings available inside of WordPress.

By default, WordPress has made a few assumptions for you when dealing with user data exports. Privacy WP allows you to edit the default assumptions made by WordPress.

**Editable Privacy Options**
* Export File Expiration: WordPress will automatically remove the export files your users request three days after they are generated. This plugin lets you set a different length of time if you need it to expire in more/less time.
* Confirmation Messages: After a user clicks the link in the email to confirm that they want to export or erase their data WordPress shows a confirmation message to the user on your site. These messages are pretty generic, so if you would like to provide more information to your users, you can do so with this plugin!
* Export Data Email: When your users request their data, it is sent to them in an email that is pretty generic. If you would like to include more information to the user, this plugin makes it easy to do.
